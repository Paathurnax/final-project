- The game was well built and has nice visuals that are simple yet nice.
- There still are some bugs remaining but are fun to find.
- I enjoyed playing the games
- 8.5/10

# cs person
- preload function could have been more effective, takes too long to load
- the controls are great but the game lacks visual appeal
- the snake cant move backwards(skill issue imo)
- asteroids and breakout are cool but snake lacks realism(bro its a game)
