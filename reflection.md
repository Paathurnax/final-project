# Reflection

# advice for past me

- Focus on more than one game, dont code one at a time
- think before you code, draw out a plan first
- write neater code


# Hardest Part

- picking a proper idea, that is precisely why i made 3 games instead of one

# Most Proud of

- breakout, as i coded it all on sunday
- sound effects and music

# Did I Complete My Needs To Have?

- yes although the ui is slightly lacking

# Were There Any Problems You Couldn't Solve?

- no not so much, except for clipping issues in breakout, but that was more of a time thing
